1- create a modal component that has props for onClose (a function called when I press the close button) and children

2- the modal component should render the children and a close button

3- add a (boolean) state to app.jsx to keep track of whether the modal is open or closed

4- Conditionally render the component from App.jsx

5- Pass in a function for onClose which will update the state
